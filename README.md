# Data Scientist Salary Prediction App

This project is a machine learning web application that predicts the salary of a data scientist based on user-input job attributes such as experience level, company size, job location, and employment type. The app is built using Python and Streamlit.

## 🚀 Features
- Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering on salary datasets
- Machine learning model (e.g., Linear Regression) trained and tested for optimal prediction accuracy
- Interactive web application built with Streamlit
- User-friendly interface to input job details and view real-time salary predictions

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used contains real-world salary data for data science roles, including:
- Job title
- Experience level
- Employment type
- Location
- Company size
- Salary in USD

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Streamlit
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis & model development

## 📈 Model
The machine learning model was trained on the processed dataset using regression algorithms. Performance was evaluated with standard metrics (MAE, RMSE, R²).

## 🖥️ Deployment
The app is deployed locally using Streamlit. To run it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SubhaniShaik786/Data-Scientist-Salary-Prediction-App.git
cd Data-Scientist-Salary-Prediction-App
streamlit run app.py
